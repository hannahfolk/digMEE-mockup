# DigMEE Mockup

This is a mockup for DigMEE for a temp position.

## Process

I started by adding in the content and the words on the mockup. Next I formatted the grid by placing in all the rows and columns. I also researched which fonts looked closest to the one in the picture and decided on Open Sans. After that it came down to formatting each section based on classes and ids and trying to figure out widths and margins of each section.
